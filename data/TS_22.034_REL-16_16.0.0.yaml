abstract:
- content: This specification describes the Stage 1 description of HSCSD. HSCSD is
    a feature that allows users subscribing to the general bearer services to access
    user rates that can be achieved with one or more traffic channel. HSCSD also defines
    a flexible use of air interface resources, which makes efficient and flexible
    use of higher user rates feasible.
