abstract:
  content: "This specification describes the content of the Stage 1 requirement for
    realization of VHE. VHE is defined as a concept for personal service environment
    (PSE) portability across network boundaries and between terminals. The concept
    of the VHE is such that users are consistently presented with the same personalized
    features, user interface customization and services in whatever network and whatever
    terminal (within the capabilities of the terminal and the network), wherever the
    user may be located.\r\nA key feature to support VHE is the ability to build services
    using a standardized application interface."
